# Two-Way Chat Server

Single-threaded TCP two-way client-server chat application in C, using BSD 
sockets, so it's immediately portable to any POSIX-compliant system, and has 
already been tested on both Linux and FreeBSD.

# Group Chat Server

Multi-threaded TCP group chat server and client apps in Java, so it's already
cross-compatible. Can handle an arbitrary amount of users, and uses Java's Swing
graphics library modules for a simple, yet effective, graphical UI.
